    <h2>The Main Components of a Karahi:</h2>
    <h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken</li>
            <p>In this recipe, I’ve used a rather small chicken which was only 550g in total weight. If your chicken
                weighs more, please do make adjustments for the quantities of tomatoes, spices and oil</p>
            <img src="leg piece.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250">
            <li>Fresh Ginger</li>
            <p>this is a very defining component of any Karahi. We use ginger in both the curry gravy as well as in the
                garnish in its raw form. Ginger is a very prominent flavour of a Karahi, so this is definitely not
                something to skimp on! Use a heavy hand with this!</p>
            <img src="ginger.jpg" alt="">
            <li>Fresh Garlic</li>
            <p>another important component of the Karahi, however its flavour definitely does take a backseat in
                comparison to its aforementioned brother, ginger. Use a heavy hand with this too! We use quite a lot of
                garlic in Karahis to help bulk up the masala too, since there aren’t any onions in here.</p>
            <img src="download.jpg" alt="">
            <li>Fresh Tomatoes</li>
            <p>A Karahi is a tomato based curry. The original, traditional recipe does not contain onions. I will repeat
                this again (and again and again) – onions have been added into mainstream Karahis for the sole reason
                that it bulks up the masala on the cheap. My recipe doesn’t use onions because quite frankly I’m a
                Karahi purist and if it contains onions, it ain’t a Karahi to me!</p>
